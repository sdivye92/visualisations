## Double Pendulum Simulator

Double pendulum simulator which shows an animation of the double pendulum moving across its state space by solving its state space equations. The simulator uses `odeint` to solve the differential equations and `matplotlib` for plotting.

To run the simulation, run following command on terminal
```sh
python main.py
```

Arm lengths and intinal angles for the pendulum can be changes in `main.py` file while creating `Simulation` class object.
